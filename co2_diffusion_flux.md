Calculated an estimate for the amount of CO2 that will diffuse onto a surface to undergo a reaction

- Fick's Law, integrate both sides
- CO2 concentration in air starting from 0.041% by volume
-   Estimate for the weight of 1 L of air at sea level taken to be 1.225 grams
-   Intermediate result for concentration of CO2 in air: Cair = 1.1E-5 mol / L
- CO2 in air diffusion constant taken to be 0.16E-4 m^2 / s at 20 degrees C
- CO2 molar mass = 44 grams / mole

- Result: 
    - 7.7 E -4 grams * s^-1 * m^-2
    - 1.76 E -5 moles * s^-1 * m^-2
